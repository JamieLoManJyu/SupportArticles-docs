# Purchase Order Line Deletion Restriction

## Symptoms
Users are unable to delete purchase order lines under specific conditions.

## Causes:
A design change was introduced in version 10.0.33 to prevent potential data corruption. This change restricts users from deleting purchase order lines if any of the following conditions are met:

The purchase order is currently or was previously confirmed, and
Either of the following applies:
1. The purchase order is budget-controlled.
2. Encumbrance accounting is enabled.

## Resolution
This restriction was implemented to safeguard data integrity by preventing the deletion of purchase order lines in these scenarios.

## Workaround
If there is a need to remove a purchase order line, the recommended approach is to first cancel the line and then finalize it.

To cancel the whole quantity on a PO line, user should cancel the delivery remainder quantity on the line. The line will then be updated to Canceled status.

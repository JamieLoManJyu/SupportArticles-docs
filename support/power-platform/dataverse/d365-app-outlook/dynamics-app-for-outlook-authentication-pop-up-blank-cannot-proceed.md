# App for Outlook authentication pop-up is blank and unable to sign in

The article solves an issue where you can't sign in to Dynamics 365 App for Outlook successfully due to a blank authentication pop-up.

## Symptoms

When you open the [Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](/dynamics365/outlook-app/overview), it prompts you to allow an authentication pop-up. After allowing, the pop-up opens. However, it is blank and prevents you from selecting an account to authenticate and sign in.

## Cause

This behavior is due to a recent regression that has been mitigated. However, users who have previously signed in might still experience this issue until they clear their session and sign in again.
